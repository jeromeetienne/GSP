"""
This example illustrates how to use the gsp.io machinery to write
a new GSP backend. To do so, each new class needs to inherit from the
Object class and then, each method that has a command decorator, will
lead to the creation of a Command when called. This command will be
recorded to the default command queue.

If the method is called with a parameter whose type does not
correspond to the documented one, it is possible to register a
converter that will be used when needed. In this example, the creation
method requires an integer as parameter but when called with float, it
is actually registered to be later converted using the provided
converter (float_to_int). This conversion occurs just-in-time (when
needed).

Once several of commands have been recorded, it is possible to
re-execute them or to save them on a file. Finally, it is also
possible to load them and run them.

Keywords: command, queue, yaml, json
